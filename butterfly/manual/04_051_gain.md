The Gain controls are essentially the same so the following information will apply to both of them despite them focussing on separate channels.
</div>
<br/>

#### Gain-Slider
<span class="txt-yellow">*(Located at the outside of the plugin)*</span>\
Left-click and drag to adjust the gain of the respective mid or side channel. This gain is aplied after the upwards compressor, so it can be used as a make-up- (or rather bring-down-)gain of the compressor.

#### Phase-Button
<span class="txt-yellow">*(Located below the gain-slider)*</span>\
<div class="block bg-dark-1">
- <span class="txt-purple">Off</span>, which leaves the signal as is.
- <span class="txt-purple">On</span>, which inverts the polarity at the input of the respective channel.
