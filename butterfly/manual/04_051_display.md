### Analyer View
<span class="location">*(Located at the edge of the plugin)*</span>\
<div class="block controls bg-dark-2">
- <span class="item">Left-Click</span> Cycle through modes.
</div>
The analyer has 3 different display modes through which it cycles:
<div class="block bg-dark-1">
- <span class="txt-purple">Off</span>: Disables the spectrum analyzer.
- <span class="txt-purple">Pre</span>: Displays the incoming signal.
- <span class="txt-purple">Post</span>: Displays the outgoing signal.
</div>
<span class="spacer"/>

### Corelation Meter
<span class="location">*(Located below the gain-slider)*</span>\
The correlation meter is a common indicator for showing how mono-compatible the signal is.

### Link
<span class="location">*(Located bottom-center of the Display)*</span>\
Click to link the Mid-Side-Controls (Gain, Phase, Filters, Compressor and Delay) together for changing the values in tandem. 
This provides easy access to modify both mid and side channels.

Please note that this will only affect changes made via the interface and not automation.
If automation is used to change any of the parameters when linking is enabled, only the automated
parameter will change whereas the other counterpart will remain unaffected.

This is to done avoid potentially conflicting input from different automation tracks.
