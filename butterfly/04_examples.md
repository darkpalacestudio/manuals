# Examples and Tricks


<div class="block bg-dark-1">
- Broaden a pad or electric guitars by applying the spread eq. 
- Enhance the width of your master track by increasing the side gain.
- Create a clear bass image by applying a lowcut on the side channel.
- Boost the stereo image by applying a boosting high shelf on the side channel.
- Enhance the depth of your mix by applying a small amount of delay on the side channel.
- Create an interesting stereo comb filter effect by putting the plugin in L/R Mode and applying delay on one of the two channels.

## Compressor timing


When in **Slow** mode, the compressor timings change linearly over the range of **-40dB** to **0dB**:
<div class="block bg-dark-1">
- Attack (Slow) is in the range of 40ms to 400ms
- Release (Slow) is in the range of 100ms to 1000ms
</div>

The above timings are for the **Slow** mode. This is suitable for gentle compressions that impart little harmonic distortion, especially in oversampled mode.

The **Fast** mode delivers a way more aggressive sound due to the shorter attack and release timings.
When the compressor is switched to **Fast** mode, the timings are down by a factor of 0.1, effectively resulting in the following timings
<div class="block bg-dark-1">
- Attack (Fast) is in the range of 4ms to 40ms
- Release (Fast) is in the range of 10ms to 100ms
</div>


## Auto Mode compression
The compressor being in Auto mode means that signal at the compressor input determines the specific compressor timing.
By increasing the input gain of the plugin (and simultaneously decreasing the output gain), one can tailor the compression sound.
