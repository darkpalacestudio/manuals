#### Gain-Slider
<span class="location">*(Located at the edge of the plugin)*</span>\
<div class="block controls bg-dark-2">
- <span class="item">Left-Click and Drag:</span> Change Gain value.
</div>
The gain is processed *after* the channel-controls, allowing it to be used as make-up-gain (or rather bring-down-gain) for the upwards compressor.

#### Polarity-Button
<span class="location">*(Located below the gain-slider)*</span>\
<div class="block controls bg-dark-2">
- <span class="item">Left-Click:</span> Toggle Polarity.
</div>

The Gain meters has 2 different states for polarity:
<div class="block bg-dark-1">
- <span class="txt-purple">Off</span>: Leave the signal as is.
- <span class="txt-purple">On</span>: Inverts the polarity.
