# Introduction {#sec:introduction}

The <span class="txt-green">Chameleon Suite</span> is a comprehensive collection of audio-plugins based on the concept of allpass 
filters that will unlock and empower you with creative flexibility and precision for your audio projects.

The suite offers the following plugins:
<div class="block bg-dark-1">
- <span class="txt-green">**Chameleon 1**</span>: First order allpass filter with frequency control
- <span class="txt-green">**Chameleon 2**</span>: Second order allpass filter with frequency and q controls
- <span class="txt-green">**Chameleon N**</span>: Nth 2nd order allpass filter with frequency, q and order controls
- <span class="txt-green">**Chameleon X**</span>: Artfully stacking X allpass filters for full creative freedom

## Allpass filters
Allpass filters are one of the most fundamental building-blocks in the world of signal processing, 
and while they are not as popular or well-known as other types of filters, they play a crucial 
role when it comes to shaping sound and can be used to create almost all other filter types.

In general, an allpass filter is characterized by the fact that they pass through all frequencies 
without a change in level. This means that by themselves they are unable to shape frequencies one 
would normally do with a bell-, shelf-, notch- or any other type of filter.

They do, however, introduce a phase shift which can be used for other creative purposes. As the 
phase shift is frequency dependant, you can think of this as a frequency-dependant delay whereas 
standard delays delay the the complete signal, an allpass filter delays different frequencies 
by different amounts of time

## Chameleon Plugins

<span class="txt-green">Chameleon 1</span> and <span class="txt-green">Chameleon2</span> are your 
bread and butter allpass-filters. By mixing, adding and/or subtracting the processed signal from 
the dry signal they can create low-, notch-, high- and bandpass-filters, See section @sec:examples 
for further details.

<span class="txt-green">Chameleon N</span> stacks multiple 2nd order allpass filters at the same 
frequency resulting in an Nth order allpass filter that allows for wild processing as the phase 
rotation quickly sums up.

Finally, <span class="txt-green">Chameleon X</span> distributes multiple 2nd order allpass filters 
around a central frequency with additional controls for the placement of the filters to allow for
frequency dependant delays, dispersed sounds, pitch-shifting and far more!
