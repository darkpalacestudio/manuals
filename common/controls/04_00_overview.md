- <span class="txt-red">Gain Meters</span>
- <span class="txt-blue">Control Area</span>
- <span class="txt-green">Footer</span>
</div>
<span class="spacer"/>

Whereas shared interactions include:

<div class="block bg-dark-1">
- Double-Clicking on a widget to reset it to its default value.
- Holding `SHIFT` or `CTRL` while dragging a widget to allow for precise adjustments.
- Using the mouse-wheel to adjust a widget in incremental steps.
- Hovering over a widget for a short time shows a tooltip.
- Changing the value of any widget makes a tooltip show the current value.
- Pressing the `?` button *(located bottom-left)* will turn on explanations.
