# Introduction

<span class="txt-green">Caterpillar</span> applies bell-shaped peak filters with alternating gain to the left and right audio channels, creating a unique stereo effect while maintaining full mono compatibility.


By boosting and cutting specific frequencies differently in each channel, <span class="txt-green">Caterpillar</span> can:

- enhance the perceived stereo width
- make the soundstage feel broader and more immersive
- be used to create formant-like filters
- create unique resonances in the bass domain or the high frequency spectrum
- create transitions by applying modulation effects or automation.
