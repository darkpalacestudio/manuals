- Enhance the perceived stereo width by using a low number of broad bells and 3dBâ€“6dB of gain.
- Create formant like filters by applying a mid to high number of very steep bell peaks.
- Use automation to increase the gain and frequency range to create never-heard transitions between parts in a song.
- Use an equal number of modes in the filter count to keep the volume of both L and R channel roughly equal. An odd filter count will result in one channel being louder than the other.
