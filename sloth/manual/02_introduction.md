# Introduction

<span class="txt-green">Sloth</span> brings the concept of slew rate limiting to the digital domain.
In electronics "slew rate" is the change of voltage over time.
When the input signal at an amplifier switches instantly, the output will not immediately change, but "slew" to the new
value at a certain rate.

Applying slew rate limiting can result in a variety of effects, including denser signals, subtle darkening of the
tone, enhanced texture of sounds, creative transient shaping and even massively crushed effects.
